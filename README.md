## Introduction

As a Division I track and field athlete, I tracked my fair share of running data. My high school coach, a very influential figure in my life, tracked all of my workouts in high school with an elaborate spreadsheet he called **The Matrix**. As a Software Engineering student now, I was inspired to build a web-app that advances the idea of **The Matrix**, making it a comprehensive web-app designed to enhance the analysis of distance runners' training logs. Whether  logging distance runs or structured workouts, this app allows distance runners to track their training and aggregate their data on an easily digestible user interface. Itâ€™s designed for athletes who are committed to understanding and improving their performance through detailed and organized data tracking, reflecting the same passion and dedication that my coach instilled in me.
